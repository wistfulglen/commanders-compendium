This compendium aims to cover everything you need to know as a commander in Guild Wars 2. It will contain general tips and tricks, guides on all commonly run PvE content, as well as builds fit for both open world and intanced PvE content. It is designed with Material for MkDocs and hosted on Github Pages.

Do be aware that this is very much intended to be a compendium to suit my own needs as a commander, so keep that in mind if you ever randomly stumble upon this. For example, I have no intentions of covering WvW commanding, seeing as I currently have no interest in such.
